# React -  GitHub API project

This is a simple Github user search based application with a ReactJS + Kendo library + Github API tech stack.

This is a nodejs project, so just do an 'npm install' and 'npm start' on the root folder to get going.

For running test cases, just run 'npm test'.

I have used mocha as it is easily pluggable. It runs on both node.js and browser.
